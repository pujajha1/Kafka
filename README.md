# Kafka

StreamingTxtFile let you read CSV or Text file using Kafka.
We start Zookeeper and Kafka Server.
Then, we start Consumer and start producing the data using custom config files:mystandalone.properties and mysourcefile.properties.
In case, you want to write data to another location, you can use myfilesink.properties as well.
It works with .txt and .csv as well
